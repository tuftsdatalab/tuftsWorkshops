## Going Home
---------------------------


Sometimes we get lost, so it is useful to know a few ways to get back to where you started.

```
cd

```

This command returns you to your home directory. Check by typing this command.

```
pwd
```

Other options for going back to your home directory:

```
cd ~
```

```
cd $HOME
```

When lost in the file structure, going home is a good place to start.
