**December 6, 2022**

## TTS Research Technology Instructors

- Jason Laird, M.S., Bioinformatics Scientist

## Goals

!!! abstract ""

    - Understand the background of Protein Structure Prediction
    - Understand how AlphaFold2 takes a protein sequence and creates a predicted protein structure
    - Analyze AlphaFold2 output and determine how well it compares to available structures
    - Visualize protein structures in PyMOL
    - Optional: Write an AlphaFold2 batch script
