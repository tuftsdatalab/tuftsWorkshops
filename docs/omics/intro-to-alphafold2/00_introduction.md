## Introduction to AlphaFold2

**December 6, 2022**

## TTS Research Technology Instructors

- Jason Laird, M.S., Bioinformatics Scientist


## Materials Needed

- Account on [Tufts HPC](https://access.tufts.edu/research-cluster-account){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [VPN](https://access.tufts.edu/vpn){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} if accessing the HPC from off campus
- [PyMOL](https://access.tufts.edu/pymol){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

## Goals

!!! abstract ""

    - Understand the background of Protein Structure Prediction
    - Understand how AlphaFold2 takes a protein sequence and creates a predicted protein structure
    - Analyze AlphaFold2 output and determine how well it compares to available structures
    - Visualize protein structures in PyMOL
    - Optional: Write an AlphaFold2 batch script
