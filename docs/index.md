# About Tufts Research Technology Bioinformatics

Research Technology Bioinformatics provides consultations to Tufts students, faculty and researchers. In addition we maintain bioinformatics tools on the [Tufts HPC Cluster](https://it.tufts.edu/high-performance-computing) and the [Tufts Galaxy Platform](https://galaxy.pax.tufts.edu). We also lead in-class sessions, partner on grants, and develop workshops. If you have suggestions for future workshops, please reach out to [bioinformatics-workshop-questions@elist.tufts.edu](bioinformatics-workshop-questions@elist.tufts.edu).
