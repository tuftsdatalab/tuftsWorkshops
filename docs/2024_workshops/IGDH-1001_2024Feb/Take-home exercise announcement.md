This assignment (https://github.com/shirleyxueli41/Tufts_workshops/blob/main/IGDH-1001_2024Feb/Take-home%20exercise.md ) is structured into two main exercises focused on exploring and analyzing biological data related to the microbiota of diverse vinegars.
Exercise 1 is divided into three parts:
* 1.1 asks students to research a specific bioproject (PRJNA891065) on the NCBI database to summarize the project, count the biosamples, and identify the genes sequenced.
* 1.2 involves reading and summarizing the abstract of a research paper associated with the bioproject, focusing on the characterization of vinegar microbiota using omics tools.
* 1.3 requires detailed information about a specific SRA run (SRR21926282), including sequencing instruments, strategy, read type, total reads, and sample details from the biosample page.

  
Exercise 2 instructs students to review materials on a "Hands-on session," identify specific SRA runs from given samples, process them using Galaxy, and analyze the top 3 genera and create a Krona plot for each sample. The exercise emphasizes comparing samples from wineries and breweries.
The assignment concludes with writing a report that includes answers to all questions, results from Galaxy analyses, screenshots, and a summary comparing winery and brewery samples. The rubric outlines the points allocation for each task, totaling 25 points.

1 Exercise 1.1 (1 point for each question, 3 points in total) 2 Exercise 1.2 (2 points) 3 Exercise 1.3 (1 point for each question, 5 points in total) 4 Exercise 2:
* Identify the SRA ID (1 point for each sample, 4 points in total)
* Process the SRA in Galaxy and identify the top three genera for each sample. (1 point for each sample, 4 points in total)
* Visualize the results with Krona plots (1 point for each sample, 4 points in total)

Warning: we ask to identify the top three genera for each sample instead of species in the take-home exercise.
